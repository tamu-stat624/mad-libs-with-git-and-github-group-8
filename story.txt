going for a ride on a blue rocket in December. There are 8 [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!!

I am writing to you from a colorful spaceship in a sweaty galaxy. I found myself here one day after going for a ride on a blue rocket in December. There are 8 satellites and cluster of stars here! In the Play room there is a pool full of lemonade. 
I fall asleep each night on a large bed of silk and dream of surfing joyfully.  It feels as though I have lived here for 100 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is travel on a fast rocket!!

Best wishes,
Arushi
