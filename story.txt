Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Victoria,

I am writing to you from a colorful spaceship in a sweaty galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in December. There are 8 satellites and cluster of stars here! In the Play room there is a pool full of lemonade. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
travel on a fast rocket!!

Best wishes,
Arushi
