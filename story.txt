Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Victoria,

I am writing to you from a colorful spaceship in a sweaty galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in December. There are 8 [7] and [8] of [9] here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[16] seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
travel on a fast rocket!!

Best wishes,
Arushi
